# Chunkfile Uploader

## Overview
Chunkfile Uploader is a C# project designed to facilitate the uploading of large files by breaking them into smaller, more manageable chunks. This uploader is particularly useful when dealing with files that are too large to be uploaded in a single request, such as videos, large documents, or archives.

## Features
- **Chunking**: Automatically breaks large files into smaller chunks for easier uploading.
- **Resumable Uploads**: Supports resuming uploads from where they left off, even if the connection is interrupted or the upload is paused.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed progress tracking, allowing users to monitor the upload status of each chunk.
- **Configurable Chunk Size**: Allows users to customize the size of each chunk based on their specific requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to ensure uploads are reliable and any issues are promptly addressed.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Designed to work on various platforms and environments where C# is supported.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the solution to generate the executable file.
4. Use the executable in your projects to facilitate chunked file uploads.

## Usage
1. Include the Chunkfile Uploader library in your C# project.
2. Instantiate the uploader object and configure it with your desired settings.
3. Call the appropriate methods to initiate and manage file uploads.
4. Monitor the progress of uploads and handle any errors or interruptions as needed.

```csharp
// Example usage:
ChunkfileUploader uploader = new ChunkfileUploader();
uploader.ChunkSize = 1024 * 1024; // Set chunk size to 1 MB
uploader.UploadFile("path/to/large/file.ext");
